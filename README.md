# EMG-Based Speech Synthesis: Personalised Wearable for Speech Impaired Communication

## Overview

This is a research-driven project aimed at developing a novel system for **silent speech recognition** using mainly **Electromyography (EMG)** signals. The goal is to recognize and synthesize speech based on the electrical activity of facial muscles without the need for vocalization.
